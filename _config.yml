    unpredictable weather). At Caltech he is the fencing team foil squad captain and SAAC 
    representative, a member of chemistry club and ultimate frisbee team, and the Fleming House 
    food committee representative. In his free time, he likes to hike, write poetry, shoot photos, 
    and explore LA for trendy food."
