These past six months have been a whirlwind- from having to move out of Caltech housing in March within a week’s notice due to COVID-19, to starting the first term of my junior year, there’s definitely been a lot of change. When I went home in March, it was to a completely new state- my family had just moved from Chino, CA to New Jersey in January (great timing, huh?). While I missed seeing my friends from home, it was fun to have the chance to explore a completely new place. While the pandemic of course limited what I could do and see, I did get to experience walks through nature and along rivers which I wouldn’t have gotten in the SoCal suburb of our previous address.

## A mini vacation
  In September, my parents and I even took a road trip to see a bit more of the east coast, stopping in Boston and Newport, RI. Boston’s cobblestone streets and brick brownstones hold a very quaint charm, and I think it’s a place I could eventually see myself living in one day. Newport was more than charming- it was pretty much the New England sailing town of my dreams. I love (like, LOVE) being on boats and it’s been a long-time goal of mine to learn to sail! In Newport I got to board a real sail-powered boat for the first time, in the same waters where one of the world’s most famous sailing regattas (the America’s Cup) takes place.

After six months of staying inside, our small trip was a welcome way to say goodbye to the east coast before I would be moving back to California for term.

## Coast to coast
  I’m now living with a couple of fellow Techers at my fourth residence of the year in Redondo Beach, CA. Since settling into our place, the kitchen has been where we’ve spent most of our time, trying out new recipes for meals and desserts. On the menu at our house might be: garlic naan made from scratch (it’s even better than at some restaurants I’ve been to), kimchi tofu dumplings, homemade Olive Garden copy-cat breadsticks, sourdough pizza, or lace cookies! Our sourdough starter (Michael Bublé) and our basil plant (taking name suggestions) are always ready to lend a hand. Check out my roommate's baking insta (@yeastofourworries) if you wanna see our bakes!

My roommates and I at the beach, which is only a 10 minute drive from home!

Term is now quickly picking up pace, but we’re looking forward to these next few months.
