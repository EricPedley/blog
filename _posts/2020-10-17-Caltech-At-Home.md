Annyeonghaseyo! 

Rather than continue staying at home, this term I'm taking my online classes from Seoul, Korea. This sounds a bit crazy, but it ended up working for me for a couple of reasons: I have a friend who has been living in Seoul for the past year who I could live with, all of my classes this term are recorded lectures, I found a special student VISA that lets me stay in Korea for 18 months with the benefit of being able to quarantine in my own apartment, and finally the incredibly low Covid rates compared to the US. 

I've been here about a month now and am starting to pick up some Korean as well as all the cultural norms. I still don't bow enough when meeting people! But taking a step back, let me quickly cover how I got here. 

## Journey to Korea

Traveling to Korea was a bit of a mess, so here's a quick run-down:
* I packed everything I needed and stored the rest in the 36 hours between my internship finishing Friday and my flight early Sunday morning from LAX
* My second flight from Vancouver to Seoul got delayed by 20 hours due to a Typhoon, but fortunately I was given a hotel room nearby to stay the night
* I was stopped at the gate and told I might need a covid test due to new regulations from a few days prior. After waiting around for 15 minutes with peak anxiety, the gate attendant said I was good to go
* Following the 12-hour flight, it took another 8 hours to fill out the quarantine paperwork, wait for a special quarantine bus, and eventually make it back to the apartment I would be staying in

With that all behind me, I bunkered down for my 2-week total lockdown quarantine. I spent most of my time studying and taking the GRE, then working on my orbital dynamics research. Overall, I didn't find quarantine to be too terrible and was able to get a lot of things done! 

## How it's going

My first night free, and many nights since, we went out to an all you can eat pork belly restaurant that had some fantastic food! We got to wear these cool aprons to and keep all the drippings off ourselves.

Also, I have also started training with a swim team here called Swim Monster. I have to say, their team is aptly named because every practice has beaten me badly. But while I'm working on getting back into shape, I'm getting good with my Korean numbers! Between distances, intervals, and the coaches reading off times, I get more than enough practice hearing numbers. 

I promise I'll talk more about Caltech stuff going forward, I just thought it would be best to start off with a general life update before the more Techy things! But what do you guys want to hear about? Here are some things I might talk about in the future if people want to hear it:
* The housing system at Caltech
* Undergraduate research at Caltech
* Classes and student resources (TAs, Dean's Tutors, studying in generalâ€¦)
* Caltech Athletics
* Working at LIGO
* Summer Internships
* Clubs at Caltech
* My academic interests - ie cool physics and space engineering
* What I'm currently up to!
